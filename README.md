# MetaBioTax
MetaBioTax is a simple yet efficient metagenomics pipeline designed to align Illumina and Nanopore reads, classify sequences taxonomically, and analyze biodiversity. It efficiently processes genomic data, generating taxonomic summaries and species counts for key taxa, optimized for large-scale metagenomic studies.
